## Description

This is a tiny project to practice the HTML knowledge acquired in the Foundations Course of The Odin Project.
In this project I built a very simple HTML recipes website containing the Home Page and 3 links directing to the specific recipes pages.

## Concepts practiced

- Create HTML boiler-plate
- Add elements:
  - headings
  - paragraphs
  - images
  - ordered lists
  - unordered lists
  - links
- Add subpages
- Link subpages to homepage
