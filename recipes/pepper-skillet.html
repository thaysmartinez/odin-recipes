    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This unstuffed pepper skillet is much easier to make than actual stuffed
      peppers but packs just as much flavor. A super satisfying and delicious
      dish.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>
        8 ounces mini sweet peppers, sliced crosswise (about 10 peppers, mixed
        colors)
      </li>
      <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground sirloin (90/10)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup water</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons hot cherry pepper hoagie spread (such as Cento)</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>
        1 (8.8 ounce) package microwavable white rice (such as Uncle Ben’s),
        crumbled
      </li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil or flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add peppers and
        onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add
        beef and cook, stirring to crumble, until lightly browned, about 5
        minutes. Season with garlic and Italian seasoning and cook, stirring
        constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato sauce, water,
        hoagie spread, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in rice until coated evenly
        with sauce. Cover, reduce heat to medium to maintain a simmer, and cook
        until rice and vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes, stirring once
        halfway through to prevent sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Uncover, remove from heat, and sprinkle with shredded cheese. Re-cover
        and let sit until cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve hot sprinkled with
        basil or parsley.
      </li>
    </ol>
